lacquer - a thin layer of convenience on top of useful Python libraries.

The intent of this simple project is to serve as a collection point to
various utilities that many of us keep on (re)writing to make both the
Python standard library and other tools more pleasant to use.

By having a central collection point we hope to make it easier for us to
share and minimize duplication and divergence of all of these little
helpers, while remaining very easy to include as source into a third-party
project.

Our intent is that over time, anything in lacquer that becomes sufficiently
mature and production-ready will be shipped upstream back to the project it
adds support for, be it the Python standard library or any other third-party
tool (such as sphinx or nose).
